# eBay Calculator

![Alt text](sample.jpg?raw=true "eBay Calculator screenshot")

I tried a bunch of calculators but they had too many bells and whistles or not enough.

This eBay Calculator is completely portable... no registry writing... no system scanning... just the stuff you care about.


I've updated it to include
- latest USPS shipping costs (as of January 22, 2017)
- variable PayPal transaction fees
- actual shipping vs discounted shipping
- Power Seller Discount
- No Store vs. Basic Store / Premium Store / Anchor Store discount distinction
- quick access to the system calculator
- Final Value Fees percentage
